<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->

**Songlin (ÊùæÁê≥)** is a second-year PhD student at [MIT CSAIL](https://www.csail.mit.edu/), advised by [Prof. Yoon Kim](https://people.csail.mit.edu/yoonkim/). She earned her bachelor's degree from [SUSTech](https://www.sustech.edu.cn/en/) in 2020 and her master's degree from [ShanghaiTech](https://www.shanghaitech.edu.cn/eng/) in 2023, where she was advised by [Prof. Kewei Tu](https://faculty.sist.shanghaitech.edu.cn/faculty/tukw/).

Her research focuses on the intersection of **machine learning systems** and **large language models**, with a particular interest in hardware-aware algorithm design for efficient sequence modeling ‚Äî especially in linear attention models. For more on her work, see this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0HJvGSWw8A) and her [slides](https://github.com/sustcsonglin/linear-attention-and-beyond-slides/blob/main/main.pdf).

She is a strong advocate for open-source research üê≥. Explore the open-source library [flash-linear-attention](https://github.com/fla-org/flash-linear-attention) and the fully virtual seminar series [Advances in Sequence Modeling from Algorithmic Perspectives](https://asap-seminar.github.io/) ‚Äî past talks are available [here](https://www.youtube.com/@ASAPSeminarSeries). The best way to reach her is through the [FLA Discord Community](https://discord.gg/vDaJTmKNcS).
